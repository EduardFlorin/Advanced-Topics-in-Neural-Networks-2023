I've started the application by creating a function to choose where the application would run(on CPU/on GPU) followed by
a simple MLP. I've tried designing a train function that performs one epoch of training for a given model. The same goes 
for the validation function, it performs one epoch of validation for a given model.I used different configurations for the
training and validation, makingthe validation faster and managed to get to ~40% accuraccy to all optimizers configured.
